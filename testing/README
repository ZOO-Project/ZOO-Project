Please use the following syntaxe:

  ./run.sh <WPSInstance> <ServiceName>

where <WPSInstance> should be the url to a WPS Server and <ServiceName> should 
be the service name you want to run tests with.

For instance to test the Buffer service on a localhost WPS server, use the 
following command:

  ./run.sh http://localhost/cgi-bin/zoo_loader.cgi Buffer


Important note:  sometimes XML validation failed because xmllint is unable to download
a file required to validate. In such case, you can use the file /etc/xml/catalog on your
local machine to use a local copy of the missing file.

For instance, in case xml.xsd can't be downloaded, then you can download a copy using
this url http://www.w3.org/2001/xml.xsd, store it in /etc/schemas directory and then 
use the following /etc/xml/catalog file:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE catalog PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD Entity Resolution XML Catalog V1.0//EN" "http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/release/1.0/catalog.dtd">
<catalog xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog">
<rewriteSystem systemIdStartString="http://www.w3.org/2001/xml.xsd"
                rewritePrefix="file:///etc/schemas/xml.xsd" />
</catalog>

Obviously, you can do similar manipulation for the OGC schemas to use local files 
rather than downloading them for each tests.
