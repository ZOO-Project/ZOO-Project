[Buffer]
 Title = Create a buffer around a polygon. 
 Abstract = This service shall return a feature collection representing the buffer of geometry InputPolygon at distance BufferDistance. The buffer of a geometry at distance d is the Polygon or MultiPolygon which contains all points within a distance d of the geometry.
