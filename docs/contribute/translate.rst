Contribute translation
======================

Introduction
------------

This chapter aims to explain how to help translating the internal
ZOO-Kernel messages into  another language than English. Some
languages are already enabled for translating and some are not. Please
see :ref:`documentation_translation_newlang` if needed.

This chapter describes how to add a new language, how to join a language group, 
and how to translate the internal ZOO-Kernel messages.


What is Transifex for?
----------------------------------------

`Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/signup/contributor/>`_ is a croudsourcing
translation web application. It allows projects to  let people easily
translate documentation, websites, and applications.

It offers a graphic interface for those of you who don't like command
line but also some features for those who love them.

Transifex helps the translator to improve their translation with
suggestions, glossary and proofreading process.

Starting with Transifex
-----------------------

You need to subscribe to Transifex before translating. Go to
`Transifex subscribing page

account.

The project can be found here: `ZOO-Project Dashboard <https://www.transifex.com/organization/zoo-project/dashboard>`_

Request a new language
----------------------

Go to the ZOO-Project dashboard on Transifex (see link above) and
click on 'Request language'.

Creating a new language by the manager should not be too long, actually as long 
as to accept you in the team.


Translate messages
------------------

Once you are a member of the Translator team, go on the ZOO-Project
Dashboard you can translate and click on the language you want to
translate, then press the button 'Translate' and you can start
translating strings by using the online editor. Please refer to this `documentation
<http://docs.transifex.com/tutorials/txeditor/>`_ if you need details
on how to use this editor.
