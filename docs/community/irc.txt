IRC Chat
========

Some of the development of the ZOO-Project is coordinated through IRC. This page
describes how you log on to chat, ask questions, and hack around with the
developers.

Server and Channel Information
------------------------------

::

  Server: irc.freenode.net
  Channel: #zoo-project

Why IRC?
--------

IRC is a primary medium where Open Source GIS hackers congregate, collaborate,
and hack. It makes it easy to communicate things like compilation issues,
where immediate, iterative feedback allows folks to make a lot of progress.
Something that might take days of heavily-quoted emails through a mailinglist
might only take fifteen minutes on IRC.

IRC is a great way to coordinate on-line meetings. The ZOO PSC conducts their
monthly meetings through IRC.

How do I join?
--------------

- `Chatzilla <http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/>`__ is
  probably the easiest way to get going. Chatzilla works with Mozilla or
  Firefox, and once you have it installed, you can log on to the channel by
  pointing your browser at::

    irc://irc.freenode.net/#zoo-project

- There are many other IRC clients available. `This page
  <http://tikiwiki.org/ConnectingToIrc>`__ provides a good listing for many
  different platforms.
  
- You can also connect to IRC directly in your Web browser without a client:

  - goto http://webchat.freenode.net/
  - enter a nickname (usually your first initial plus your last name)
  - in "Channels" enter: zoo-project
  - Connect!
