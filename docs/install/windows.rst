Installation on Windows |trade|
====================

Install ZOO-Project binaries
-------------------------------

Using the installer
...................

Prior to run the ZOO-Project-Installer, please make sure you have IIS
and `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`__ setup on
your machine. Then download the `ZOO-Project-Installer
<https://bintray.com/gfenoy/ZOO-Project/Windows-Binaries/view>`__
corresponding to your platform. The first time you will run the
installer binary, you may be prompted to authorize it to run. Once the
installer has been run, simply access the following link:
http://localhost/zoo-demo/ to access your local demo application.

Install by hand
...................

Prior to run the ZOO-Project-Installer, please make sure you have IIS
and `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`__ setup on
your machine. Then download the `ZOO-Project
<https://bintray.com/gfenoy/ZOO-Project/Windows-Binaries/view>`__
archive corresponding to your platform. Uncompress it, then move
`cgi-bin`, `data` and `tmp` from uncompressed folder to `c:\\inetpub`,
also move `wwwroot\\zoo-demo` and `wwwroot\\tmp` to
`c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot`. To finish the installation, run the folllowing
command as administrator to allow the `zoo_loader.cgi` to run from
http://localhost/cgi-bin/zoo_loader.cgi:

   ::
   
     cd C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv
     appcmd.exe add vdirs /app.name:"Default Web Site/" /path:/cgi-bin /physicalPath:c:\inetpub\cgi-bin
     appcmd set config /section:handlers /+[name='CGI-exe1',path='*.cgi',verb='*',modules='CgiModule']





Compile ZOO-Project from source
-------------------------------

.. warning::
   Ensure to first perform the :ref:`prerequisite steps
   <install-prereq>` before compiling the ZOO Kernel.

The following steps are for use with the Microsoft Visual Studio
compiler (and tested with MSVC 2010).

1. Make sure the gnuwin32 tools ``bison.exe``  and ``flex.exe`` are found
   in your path.  You can download the GNUwin32 tools `here
   <http://www.zoo-project.org/dl/tool-win32.zip>`__.

2. Modify the ``nmake.opt`` file to point to your local libraries. Note
   that you can also use definition directly in the command line if
   you prefer. See :ref:`win_configure_options` for details about this
   options.

   
3. Execute:

   ::
   
     nmake /f makefile.vc
     
4. A file ``zoo_loader.cgi`` and ``libzoo_service.dll`` should be
   created.  Note that if another file named
   ``zoo_loader.cgi.manifest`` is also created, you will have to run
   another command:

   ::
   
     nmake /f makefile.vc embed-manifest
     
5. Copy the files ``zoo_loader.cgi``, ``libzoo_service.dll``  and
   ``main.cfg`` into your cgi-bin directory.

6. Using the command prompt, test the ZOO-Kernel by executing the
   following command:

   ::
   
     D:\ms4w\Apache\cgi-bin> zoo_loader.cgi
     
   which should display a message such as:
   
   ::
   
     Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
     Status: 200 OK
     
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
     <ows:ExceptionReport xmlns:ows="http://www.opengis.net/ows/1.1" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.opengis.net/ows/1.1 http://schemas.opengis.net/ows/1.1.0/owsExceptionReport.xsd" xml:lang="en-US" version="1.1.0">
       <ows:Exception exceptionCode="MissingParameterValue">
         <ows:ExceptionText>Parameter &lt;request&gt; was not specified</ows:ExceptionText>
       </ows:Exception>
     </ows:ExceptionReport>
     
7. Edit the ``main.cfg`` file so that it contains values describing
   your WPS service.  An example of such a file running on Windows is:
   
   ::
   
     [main]
     encoding = utf-8
     version = 1.0.0
     serverAddress = http://localhost/
     lang = en-CA
     tmpPath=/ms4w/tmp/ms_tmp/
     tmpUrl = /ms_tmp/
     
     [identification]
     title = The Zoo WPS Development Server
     abstract = Development version of ZooWPS. See http://www.zoo-project.org
     fees = None
     accessConstraints = none
     keywords = WPS,GIS,buffer
     
     [provider]
     providerName=Gateway Geomatics
     providerSite=http://www.gatewaygeomatics.com
     individualName=Jeff McKenna
     positionName=Director
     role=Dev
     adressDeliveryPoint=1101 Blue Rocks Road

     addressCountry=ca
     addressElectronicMailAddress=info@gatewaygeomatics.com
     phoneVoice=False
     phoneFacsimile=False
     
8. Open a web browser window, and execute a GetCapababilites request on your WPS service: http://localhost/cgi-bin/zoo_loader.cgi?request=GetCapabilities&service=WPS

   The response should be displayed in your browser, such as:
   
   ::
   
     <wps:Capabilities xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.opengis.net/wps/1.0.0 http://schemas.opengis.net/wps/1.0.0/wpsGetCapabilities_response.xsd" service="WPS" xml:lang="en-US" version="1.0.0">
     <ows:ServiceIdentification>
       <ows:Title>The Zoo WPS Development Server</ows:Title>
       <ows:Abstract>
         Development version of ZooWPS. See http://www.zoo-project.org
       </ows:Abstract>
       <ows:Keywords>

Optionally Compile Individual Services
.............................................................

An example could be the *OGR base-vect-ops* provider located in the ``zoo-project\zoo-services\ogr\base-vect-ops`` directory.  

1. First edit the *makefile.vc* located in that directory, and execute:

   ::
   
     nmake /f makefile.vc
     
   Inside that same directory, the *ogr_service.zo* file should be created.
   
2. Copy all the files inside ``zoo-services\ogr\base-vect-ops\cgi-env`` into your ``cgi-bin`` directory

3. Test this service provider through the following URL:

http://localhost/cgi-bin/zoo_loader.cgi?request=Execute&service=WPS&version=1.0.0&Identifier=Buffer&DataInputs=BufferDistance=1@datatype=interger;InputPolygon=Reference@xlink:href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zoo-project.org%3A8082%2Fgeoserver%2Fows%3FSERVICE%3DWFS%26REQUEST%3DGetFeature%26VERSION%3D1.0.0%26typename%3Dtopp%3Astates%26SRS%3DEPSG%3A4326%26FeatureID%3Dstates.15
   
   The response displayed in your browser should contain:
   
   ::
   
     <wps:ProcessSucceeded>Service "Buffer" run successfully.</wps:ProcessSucceeded>
