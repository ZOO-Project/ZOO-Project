About ZOO Documentation
=======================

ZOO Documentation is a collaborative process; once users contribute documentation

  Nicolas Bozon (nicolas.bozon at gmail.com)
  Gérald Fenoy (gerald.fenoy at geolabs.fr)
  Jeff McKenna (jmckenna at gatewaygeomatics.com)
  
A special thank to the ZOO-Project sponsors and knwoledge partners for their support.

The committee would like to thank ``Hirofumi Hayashi`` and ``Daisuke Yoshida`` for their help and japanese translation effort for the ZOO-Project Worshop 2010.
  
The committee would also like to thank the early contributors to the documentation: ``Luca Delucchi``, ``René-Luc D'Hont``,  ``Angelos Tzotsos`` and ``Guillaume Sueur``.
