What is ZOO-API ?
=================

ZOO-API is a server-side Javascript library for creating and chaining :ref:`services_index`. 
It lets you script on the server-side to execute WPS *Processes*, and thus to use 
common JavaScript controls and logic for WPS chaining.

Server-side JavaScript WPS
--------------------------

ZOO-API  :ref:`js-support`  works on the server-side using the Mozilla foundation `JavaScript <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript>`__
engine,  `SpiderMonkey <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey>`__. 
It uses a  `Proj4js <http://proj4js.org/>`__ adaptation for server-side reprojection. It also allows to easily 
convert vector formats (such as `GML <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml>`__,  `KML <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml>`__,  
`GeoJSON <http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html>`__, etc).
