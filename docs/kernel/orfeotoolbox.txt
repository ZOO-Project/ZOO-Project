How To Use the Orfeo Toolbox support
=============================================

:Authors: Nicolas Bozon, GÃ©rald Fenoy, Jeff McKenna

The key idea of the ZOO `Orfeo Toolbox <http://orfeo-toolbox.org/otb/>`_  support implementation is to take advantage of the `OTB Applications <http://orfeo-toolbox.org/otb/otb-applications.html>`_ by using them directly as ZOO WPS Services, without any modifications.  

Here is an overview of the installation procedure and the required configuration to activate the OTB support in ZOO-Project. 

.. Note:: These installation steps were successfully tested on Ubuntu 14.4 LTS

How to make it working ?
------------------------

Requirements
**************

   * latest `ZOO-Kernel <http://zoo-project.org/trac/browser/trunk/zoo-project/zoo-kernel>`_ trunk version
   * Orfeo Toolbox (`OTB 4.2.1 <http://orfeo-toolbox.org/otb/>`_ )
   * Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit  (`ITK-4.7 <http://itk.org/ITK/resources/software.html/>`_ )

Installation steps
********************

.. Note:: For OTB and ITK, the CMAKE_C_FLAGS and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS must first be set to ``-fPIC``

Download lastest ZOO-Kernel code from SVN.

.. code-block:: guess

    svn checkout http://svn.zoo-project.org/svn/trunk/zoo-kernel zoo-kernel

Then compile ZOO-Kernel using the needed configuration options as shown bellow:

.. code-block:: guess

     cd zoo-kernel
     autoconf
     ./configure  --with-otb=/usr/local --with-itk=/usr/local --with-itk-version=4.7 
     make
     cp zoo_loader.cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin

Configuration steps
*************************

Main configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add the following content to your ``/usr/lib/cgi-bin/main.cfg`` file 
in the ``[env]`` section:

.. code-block:: guess

       ITK_AUTOLOAD_PATH=/usr/local/lib/otb/applications

Services configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The build of the `otb2zcfg  <http://zoo-project.org/trac/browser/trunk/thirds/otb2zcfg>`_ utility is required to activate the available OTB Applications as WPS services. This can be done using the following command: 

.. code-block:: guess
	
	 mkdir build
	 cd build
	 ccmake ..
	 make
	
Run the following command to generate all the needed zcfg files for the available OTB Application:

.. code-block:: guess
	
	 mkdir zcfgs
	 cd zcfgs
	 export ITK_AUTOLOAD_PATH=/your/path/to/otb/applications
	 ../build/otb2zcfg
	 cp *zcfg /location/to/your/cgi-bin
	
.. warning 

     The ITK_AUTOLOAD_PATH environment variable is required in the [env] section of your main.cfg.

Services configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

Once done, OTB Applications should be listed as available WPS Services when runing a GetCapabilities request

.. code-block:: guess 

        http://localhost/cgi-bin/zoo_loader.cgi?request=GetCapabilities&service=WPS 

Each OTB Service can then be described individually using the DescribeProcess request, as for example:

.. code-block:: guess

   http://localhost/cgi-bin/zoo_loader.cgi?request=DescribeProcess&service=WPS&version=1.0.0&Identifier=OTB.BandMath

And executed according to your needs, as for the following example executing OTB.BandMath with the OTB sample data as input

.. code-block:: guess

   http://localhost/cgi-bin/zoo_loader.cgi?request=Execute&service=WPS&version=1.0.0&Identifier=OTB.BandMath&DataInputs=il=Reference@xlink:href=http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org/OTB-Data/raw-file/ca154074b282/Examples/verySmallFSATSW.tif;il=Reference@xlink:href=http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org/OTB-Data/raw-file/ca154074b282/Examples/verySmallFSATSW_nir.tif;out=float;exp=im1b3*cos%28im1b1%29,im1b2*cos%28im1b1%29,im1b1*cos%28im1b1%29&RawDataOutput=out@mimeType=image/png

When executing OTB applications as WPS Services, it is also possible to check the OTB process status, using the usual ZOO GetStatus request.
