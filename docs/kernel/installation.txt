This page provides documentation on how to compile then install the ZOO Kernel on Unix and Win32 platforms.

Obtaining the ZOO Kernel Source
-------------------------------

Use the following command to get the ZOO Kernel source code through Subversion:

::

  svn checkout http://svn.zoo-project.org/svn/trunk zoo-project

For users which get a developer account, use the following:

::

  sed "s:\[tunnels\]:\[tunnels\]\nzoosvn = /usr/bin/ssh -p 1046:g" -i ~/.subversion/config
  svn co svn+zoosvn://svn.zoo-project.org/var/svn/repos/trunk zoo-project

The first line of the instruction above defines a specific tunnel to access the svn server through 
the SSH protocol. Indeed, the ZOO SVN server listens on the 1046 (1024+22) port rather than the default one (22).

Prerequisites
-------------

The following libraries are required on your system before you can install the ZOO Kernel:

- autoconf (  http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ ) 
- cgic (  http://www.boutell.com/cgic )
- cURL (  http://curl.haxx.se )
- FastCGI (  http://www.fastcgi.com )
- Flex & Bison (  http://flex.sourceforge.net/  http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/ )
- libxml2 (  http://xmlsoft.org )
- OpenSSL (  http://www.openssl.org )
- Python (  http://www.python.org )

Optional libraries include:

- PHP Embedded (optional) (  http://www.php.net )
- Java SDK (optional) (  http://java.sun.com )
- SpiderMonkey (optional) (  http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/ ) 

Compile libcgic
---------------

The first step is to compile libcgic from the ``zoo-project/thirds`` directory. For such a task, please use 
the following command:

::

  cd thirds/cgic206
  make

Make sure that a ``libcgic.a`` is created in your ``zoo-project/thirds/cgic206`` directory. If yes, then 
you can go to the next step.

On Windows, rather than using the make command, please use:

::

  nmake /f makefile.vc. 
  
.. warning::
   If you don't compile libcgic first, and try to compile the ZOO Kernel, you will get an error such as *cannot find -lcgic*

Unix
----

For Unix users, the ZOO Kernel comes with a GNU autoconf "configure" script that should take care of (hopefully!) 
all compilation issues for you.

The configure script won't work on Windows. See section :ref:`WIN32 <win32>` for details on compiling 
on Windows systems. 

For the impatient
*****************

To build the ``zoo_loader.cgi`` CGI program with the default options, cd to the directory 
where you extracted the ZOO Kernel source code package and use the following commands:

::

  $ cd zoo-kernel
  $ autoconf  
  $ ./configure
  $ make

Unless something went wrong, you should have executables in the current directory for the ``zoo_loader.cgi`` 
CGI program. You can copy the ``zoo_loader.cgi`` program and the ``main.cfg`` file to your HTTP server's CGI 
directory and start using it.

At this step your ZOO-Kernel should work. Nevertheless, don't forget to correct the main.cfg settings 
to set ``tmpPath`` and ``tmpUrl`` to fit your web server configuration.

Configure Options
*****************

Here is the list of available options as returned by *./configure --help*:

::

  --with-gdal-config=FILE specify an alternative gdal-config file
  --with-xml2config=FILE  specify an alternative xml2-config file
  --with-python=PATH      To enable python support or specify an alternative
                          directory for python installation, disabled by
                          default
  --with-php=PATH         To enable php support or specify an alternative
                          directory for php installation, disabled by default
  --with-perl=PATH        To enable perl support or specify an alternative
                          directory for perl installation, disabled by default
  --with-java=PATH        To enable java support, specify a JDK_HOME,
                          disabled by default
  --with-js=PATH          specify --with-js=path-to-js to enable js support,
                          specify --with-js on linux debian like, js support
                          is disabled by default

All the options are described in more details below.

(Required) GDAL Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your gdal-config program is not found in your PATH then you can use the 
``--with-gdal-config`` option to specify its location. For instance, let's suppose that your gdal-config 
was installed in /usr/local/bin and this directory is not in your PATH, then you can use 
the following command:

::

  $ ./configure --with-gdal-config=/usr/local/bin/gdal-config

(Required) XML2 Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your xml2-config program is not found in your PATH then you can use the 
``--with-xml2config`` option to specify its location. For instance, let's suppose that 
your xml2-config was installed in /usr/local/bin and this directory is not in your PATH, 
then you can use the following command:

::

  $ ./configure --with-xml2config=/usr/local/bin/xml2-config

(Optional) Python Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to activate Python support for the ZOO Kernel then you will have to use the 
``--with-python`` option. If your python-config program is found in your PATH then you 
don't have to specify the path where Python was installed, such as:

::

  $ ./configure --with-python

This assumes that python-config is found in your PATH.

In the case that your python-config is not found in your PATH, then you can specify the Python 
installation directory you are using. For instance, let's suppose that you installed 
Python in /usr/local, then you can use the following command:

::

  $ ./configure --with-python=/usr/local

This assumes that /usr/local/bin/python-config exists.

(Optional) PHP Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To be able to activate PHP support for the ZOO Kernel you'll need to get a local PHP Embedded 
installation; for more information about the required configure options when compiling PHP you 
can refer to this page :

     http://zoo-project.org/trac/wiki/ZooKernel/Embed/PHP

If you want to activate the PHP support for the ZOO Kernel then you will have to use the 
``--with-php`` option. If your php-config program is found in your PATH then you don't have 
to specify the path where PHP was installed, then you can use the following commnd:

::

  $ ./configure --with-php

This assumes that php-config is found in your PATH.

In the case that your php-config is not found in your PATH, then you can specify the PHP installation 
directory you are using. For instance, let's suppose that you installed PHP in /usr/local, 
then you can use the following command:

::

  $ ./configure --with-php=/usr/local

This assumes that /usr/local/bin/php-config exists.

(Optional) Perl Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to activate Perl support for the ZOO Kernel then you will have to use the 
``--with-perl`` option. If you do not set any value to this option, then the perl program will 
be searched in your PATH. So in such a case, you can use the following command:

::

  $ ./configure --with-perl 

This assumes that perl is found in your PATH.

In the other case, for custom Perl installations, you can set the installation directory. For instance, 
let's suppose that you installed Perl in /usr/local and /usr/local/bin is not in your PATH, 
then you can use the following command:

::

  $ ./configure --with-perl=/usr/local

This assumes that /usr/local/bin/perl exists.

(Optional) Java Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to activate Java support for the ZOO Kernel then you will have to use the 
``--with-java`` option and set the installation path of your Java SDK. For instance, 
let's suppose that your Java SDK was installed in the /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.22/ directory, 
then you can use the following command:

::

  $ ./configure --with-java=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.22/

This assumes that the include/linux and jre/lib/i386/client/ subdirectories exist in 
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.22/, include/linux contains the jni.h headers file and 
jre/lib/i386/client/ contains the libjvm.so file.

.. note:: 
   With Mac OS X you only have to set ``macos`` as the value for the ``--with-java`` option 
   to activate Java support. For example:

   ::

     $ ./configure --with-java=macos

(Optional) JavaScript Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to activate JavaScript support for the ZOO Kernel then you will have to use 
the ``--with-js`` option. If you are using a "Debian-like" GNU/Linux distribution then 
dpkg will be used to detect if the required packages are installed and you don't have to 
specify anything here, so you can use the following command:

::

  $ ./configure --with-js 

This assumes that js_api.h and libmozjs.so are found in default directories.

If you have a custom installation of SpiderMonkey or you are not using a Debian packaging 
system, then you'll have to specify the directory where you installed it. For 
instance, let's suppose that you installed your SpiderMonkey in /usr, then you'll 
have to use the following command:

::

  $ ./configure --with-js=/usr

This assumes that the /usr/include/js exists and contains the js_api.h headers file and 
/usr/lib contains libmozjs.so file.

CentOS
******

.. note::
   This documentation was created thanks to Guillaume Sueur from Neogeo Technologies which took time to test 
   installing the ZOO-Kernel on a CentOS 5.5 environment.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install some standard tools to be able to run ZOO-Kernel on your platform :

::

  yum install apache2
  yum install build-essentials
  yum install gcc-c++
  yum install zlib-devel
  yum install libxml2-devel
  yum install bison
  yum install openssl 
  yum install python-devel
  yum install subversion

Compile then install FastCGI library from source

::

  wget http://www.fastcgi.com/dist/fcgi.tar.gz
  tar xzf fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz 
  ./configure
  make
  make install
  echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf
  ldconfig

Compile then install the autoconf tools :

::

  wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-latest.tar.gz
  tar xzf autoconf-latest.tar.gz
  ./configure --prefix=/usr
  make 
  make install

Compile then install the flex tool :

::

  wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/flex/flex/flex-2.5.35/flex-2.5.35.tar.gz?r=http%3A%2F%2Fflex.sourceforge.net%2F&ts=1292529005&use_mirror=switch
  tar xzf flex-2.5.35.tar.gz
  cd flex-2.5.35
  ./configure --prefix=/usr
  make
  make install

Using the curl provided in the CentOS distribution will produce a ZOO-Kernel unable to run any 
Service. Indeed, some segmentation faults occur when trying to run ``Execute`` requests on the ZOO-Kernel, 
compiling the ZOO-Kernel setting ``USE_GDB`` flag in the ``CFLAGS`` of your ``Makefile`` will let you run 
ZOO-Kernel from gdb and be able to get more information on what is going wrong with your ZOO-Kernel. 
Doing this we can figure out that code on `line 173 <http://zoo-project.org/trac/browser/trunk/zoo-kernel/ulinet.c#L173>`__ 
and `line 175 <http://zoo-project.org/trac/browser/trunk/zoo-kernel/ulinet.c#L175>`__ have to be commented in the 
``ulinet.c`` file to get a ZOO-Kernel working using the curl available in CentOS (curl version 7.15.5). 
If you don't apply the modification, you will get an error from a gdb session pointing 
segfault in ``Curl_cookie_clearall``.

You can optionally compile then install curl from source :

::

  wget http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.21.3.tar.bz2
  tar xjf curl-7.21.3.tar.bz2
  cd curl-7.21.3
  ./configure --prefix=/usr
  make
  make install

Compile then install Python :

::
 
  wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.6/Python-2.6.6.tar.bz2
  tar xjf Python-2.6.6.tar.bz2
  cd Python-2.6.6
  ./configure
  make
  make install

Compile then install your own GDAL library :

::

  wget http://download.osgeo.org/gdal/gdal-1.7.3.tar.gz
  tar xzf gdal-1.7.3.tar.gz
  cd gdal-1.7.3
  ./configure  # add your options here
  make
  make install

Install the Sun JAVA SDK into ``/usr/share`` then use the following command to ensure that the ``libjvm.so`` 
will be found at runtime from any context.

::

  echo /usr/share/java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0/jre/lib/i386/client/ >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/jvm.conf
  ldconfig

Compile ZOO-Kernel and ZOO-Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compile then install ZOO-Kernel and your first ZOO-Services.

First of all, compile the cgic library providen in the SVN source tree:

::

  svn co http://svn.zoo-project.org/svn/trunk zoo-project
  cd zoo-project/thirds/cgic206
  make

Compile then install ZOO-Kernel.

::

  cd ../../zoo-kernel
  ./configure --with-java=/usr/share/jdk1.6.0_23/ --with-python
  make zoo_loader.cgi
  cp main.cfg /var/www/cgi-bin/
  cp  zoo_loader.cgi /var/www/cgi-bin/

Compile then deploy your first ZOO-ServicesProviders (simple HelloPy, line 1 and 2, and the OGR base-vect-ops 
ServiceProvider, line 3 to 6):

::

  cp ../zoo-services/hello-py/cgi-env/*.zcfg /var/www/cgi-bin/
  cp ../zoo-services/hello-py/test_service.py /var/www/cgi-bin/
  cd ../ogr/base-vect-ops/
  make
  cp ./cgi-env/* /var/www/cgi-bin/
  vi /var/www/cgi-bin/main.cfg --> set your own informations here

To ensure that the ``libjvm.so`` will be found from apache, please restart it :

::

  /etc/init.d/httpd restart

Testing your ZOO-Kernel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Test your ZOO-Kernel from command line:

::

  cd /var/www/cgi-bin
  ./zoo_loader.cgi "request=Execute&service=WPS&version=1.0.0&Identifier=HelloPy&DataInputs=a=Djay"
  ./zoo_loader.cgi "request=Execute&service=WPS&version=1.0.0&Identifier=Buffer&DataInputs=BufferDistance=1@datat
