Using the Installer
-------------------

1. To install a default build of the ZOO-Project on your Mac OS X computer use the `installer <http://www.zoo-project.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/ZooDocumentation/ZOOKernel/MacOSX_installation/ZOO-Project-Installer.pkg>`__.

   .. note::
      The installer assumes that you are using the distributed Apache2 version that comes with your Mac.  The installer will
      place ZOO-Kernel and ZOO-Services into your cgi-bin at ``/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables``, and the zoo-demo folder
      will be placed within your document root at ``/Library/WebServer/Documents``

2. Make sure that your Apache server is running, and then access the ZOO Project Demo at:

      http://localhost/zoo-demo/spatialtools.html
      
3. To add additional services, please follow the following intructions to compile your own ZOO Project instance.

Compiling from Source
---------------------

1. Install `Xcode <http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/>`__.

2. Before you start downloading the ZOO-Project source code, you'll need to install some tools required to 
   compile ZOO-Kernel properly.

   First of all install PROJ, GEOS and GDAL frameworks from `here <http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks>`__.

   At this step, you should get the following directories on your local hard drive :

   ::
   
     /Library/Frameworks/PROJ.framework
     /Library/Frameworks/GEOS.framework
     /Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework

3. Then, create a ``src`` directory and inside that directory download the `gettext source code <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/#TOCdownloading>`__ and uncompress it.

   now, compile gettext with the following commands to produce a universal binary :

   ::
   
     cd gettext-0.18.1.1
     CFLAGS="-O -g -arch i386 -arch ppc -arch x86_64"  \
       LDFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch ppc -arch x86_64"   ./configure
     make
     sudo make install

4. Compile and install your ZOO-Kernel

   - Download source from SVN, and use the following command to compile libcgic :

     ::
     
       svn co http://svn.zoo-project.org/svn/trunk zoo
       cd zoo/thirds/cgic206
       make

   - If you produced the ``libcgic.a`` file, you can run ``autoconf`` and then ``configure`` from zoo-kernel directory.

     ::
     
       cd zoo/zoo-kernel
       autoconf
       ./configure --with-python --with-java=macos \
          --with-gdal-config=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/1.8/Programs/gdal-config

     Obviously, if you don't need Python or Java support then you should remove the corresponding configure option.

     .. note:: 
        Note that we used the --with-java=macos configure option. Due to the generic location of the JDK on all 
        Mac OS X platforms, you don't have to provide its full path.

   - Now, run the following commands to compile and deploy your ZOO-Kernel on your Apache server :

     ::
     
       make
       cp zoo_loader.cgi main.cfg /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables

     You should be ready to request your ZOO-Kernel installation using the following link :  http://localhost/cgi-bin/zoo_loader.cgi?request=GetCapabilities&service=WPS .

     If everything is ok, you can follow the next steps to deploy new Services Providers.
     
     .. note::
        If you are using your own libs (not the default libs on your system) then you must take care to create
        universal versions of those libs, as the ZOO-Kernel will try to create a universal binary.  If you are
        not following this advice, you might receive compile errors of ``symbol(s) not found for architecture ppc`` or ``file was built for 
        unsupported file format which is not the architecture being linked (ppc)``.
     
Deploy the OGR Services Provider
--------------------------------

Requirements
************

Before your try to use any service, please set the correct path in the ``main.cfg`` for tmpPath and tmpUrl.

You can use the following setup :

::

  tmpPath = /Library/WebServer/Documents/tmp
  tmpUrl = ../../tmp

Obviously you'll then need to create this directory, using the following command :

::

  mkdir /Library/WebServer/Documents/tmp

C Version
*********

To compile the base-vect-ops ServicesProvider you'll need to edit the Makefile in *zoo/zoo-services/ogr/base-vect-ops/* 
directory. Add "-I/Library//Frameworks/GEOS.framework/Versions/3/Headers/" to the CFLAGS value on the first line. 
To compile, add GDAL framework to the PATH environmenet variable, to ensure that gdal-config tool will be found, 
run make and then copy cgi-env files in the /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables directory.

::

  cd zoo/zoo-services/ogr/base-vect-ops/
  export PATH=$PATH:/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/1.7/Programs/
  make
  cp cgi-env/* /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables

You can test using this `url <http://localhost/cgi-bin/zoo_loader.cgi?request=Execute&service=WPS&version=1.0.0&Identifier=Buffer&DataInputs=BufferDistance=1@datatype=interger;InputPolygon=Reference@xlink:href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zoo-project.org%3A8082%2Fgeoserver%2Fows%3FSERVICE%3DWFS%26REQUEST%3DGetFeature%26VERSION%3D1.0.0%26typename%3Dtopp%3Astates%26SRS%3DEPSG%3A4326%26FeatureID%3Dstates.15>`__ 
if everything is ok with your setup.

Python Version
**************

**Requirements**

First of all run python from a Terminal.app and try the following import from the python interpreter :

::

  import osgeo.ogr
  import libxml2

If you get an issue when importing the libxml2 module from your python interpreter then that means you 
need to install the Python support for the libxml2 library which is already installed on your Mac OS X environment. 
To accomplish this, you have first to determine what version of libxml2 is installed on your platform, using the following command:

xml2-config --version

Download the source corresponding to your version (i.e. on 10.6.6 you get 2.7.3) from the libxml2  
`download page <ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/>`__ into your ``src`` directory then uncompress it.

Use the following command to install the python support :

::

  cd src/libxml2-2.7.3/python/
  python setup.py install

**Deploy OGR Python Services Provider**

- Now copy the ``zoo-services/ogt/base-vect-ops/cgi-env`` files into ``/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables``.

You can test using this `url <http://localhost/cgi-bin/zoo_loader.cgi?request=Execute&service=WPS&version=1.0.0&Identifier=BufferPy&DataInputs=BufferDistance=1@datatype=interger;InputPolygon=Reference@xlink:href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zoo-project.org%3A8082%2Fgeoserver%2Fows%3FSERVICE%3DWFS%26REQUEST%3DGetFeature%26VERSION%3D1.0.0%26typename%3Dtopp%3Astates%26SRS%3DEPSG%3A4326%26FeatureID%3Dstates.15>`__ 
if everything is ok with your setup.

Test using Local Demo Page
--------------------------

- Download the `OpenLayers <http://openlayers.org>`__ library and uncompress it in your personal Sites directory 
  (located in your home directory). 
  
- Rename the OpenLayers directory as openlayers. 

- Download this `zip archive <http://www.zoo-project.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/ZooDocumentation/ZOOKernel/MacOSX_installation/zoo-demo.zip>`__ 
  and then uncompress it in your personal Sites directory. 
  
- Load your local demo pages using urls similar to the following (replacing MyUserName by your MacOS user name) :

    *  http://localhost/~MyUserName/zoo-demo/spatialtools.html
    *  http://localhost/~MyUserName/zoo-demo/spatialtools-py.html
