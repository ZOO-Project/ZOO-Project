Obtaining the ZOO Kernel Source
-------------------------------

.. _svn:

Use the following command to get the ZOO Kernel source code through Subversion:

::

  svn checkout http://svn.zoo-project.org/svn/trunk zoo-project

For users which get a developer account, use the following:

::

  sed "s:\[tunnels\]:\[tunnels\]\nzoosvn = /usr/bin/ssh -p 1046:g" -i ~/.subversion/config
  svn co svn+zoosvn://svn.zoo-project.org/var/svn/repos/trunk zoo-project

The first line of the instruction above defines a specific tunnel to access the svn server through 
the SSH protocol. Indeed, the ZOO SVN server listens on the 1046 (1024+22) port rather than the default one (22).

Prerequisites
-------------

The following libraries are required on your system before you can install the ZOO Kernel:

- autoconf (  http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ ) 
- cgic (  http://www.boutell.com/cgic )
- cURL (  http://curl.haxx.se )
- FastCGI (  http://www.fastcgi.com )
- Flex & Bison (  http://flex.sourceforge.net/  http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/ )
- libxml2 (  http://xmlsoft.org )
- OpenSSL (  http://www.openssl.org )
- Python (  http://www.python.org )

Optional libraries include:

- PHP Embedded (optional) (  http://www.php.net )
- Java SDK (optional) (  http://java.sun.com )
- SpiderMonkey (optional) (  http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/ ) 

Compile libcgic
---------------

The first step is to compile libcgic from the ``zoo-project/thirds`` directory. For such a task, please use 
the following command:

::

  cd thirds/cgic206
  make

Make sure that a ``libcgic.a`` is created in your ``zoo-project/thirds/cgic206`` directory. If yes, then 
you can go to the next step.

On Windows, rather than using the make command, please use:

::

  nmake /f makefile.vc. 
  
.. warning::
   If you don't compile libcgic first, and try to compile the ZOO Kernel, you will get an error such as *cannot find -lcgic*
