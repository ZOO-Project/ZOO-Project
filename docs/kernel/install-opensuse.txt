Zoo-Kernel is maintained as a package in `OpenSUSE Build Service (OBS) <https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=zoo-kernel&project=Application%3AGeo>`__. 
This way, rpm's are provided for all versions of openSUSE Linux (11.2, 11.3, 11.4, Factory).

Stable Releases
---------------

For installing Zoo-Kernel in openSUSE there are 3 ways available:

One Click Installer

One-click installer that can be found  `here <http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=zoo-kernel&baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.4&lang=en&exclude_debug=true>`__. 
For openSUSE 11.4 this is the direct `link <http://software.opensuse.org/ymp/Application:Geo/openSUSE_11.4/zoo-kernel.ymp?base=openSUSE%3A11.4&query=zoo-kernel>`__.

Yast Software Manager using a GUI
*********************************

The `Application:Geo <http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Application:/Geo/>`__ repository has to be added 
to the Software Repositories and then Zoo-kernel can be found in Software Management through search.
