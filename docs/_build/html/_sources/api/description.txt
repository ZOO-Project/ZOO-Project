What is ZOO-API ?
==============

ZOO-API is a server-side JavaScript library designed to make the WPS Process creation and chaining 
easier. It works on the server-side using the Mozilla foundation `JavaScript <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript>`__
engine,  `SpiderMonkey <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey>`__. 
It uses a  `Proj4js <http://proj4js.org/>`__ adaptation for server-side reprojection. It also allows to easily 
convert vector formats (such as `GML <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml>`__,  `KML <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml>`__,  
`GeoJSON <http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html>`__, etc). The API lets you orchestrate WPS 
services simply and offers the ability to add logic and controls in the WPS chaining.
