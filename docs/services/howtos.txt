How To Setup ZOO Services
=========================

ZOO Services are quiet easy to create once you have install ZOO Kernel and that you have 
chosen a code to turn into a ZOO service. Here are some HelloWorlds in Python, PHP, Java 
and JavaScript with link to the correpondant .zcfg files.

Python
------

You'll find here informations needed to deploy your own Python Services Provider.

Python ZCFG requirements
************************

For each Services providen by your ZOO Python Services Provider, the ZCFG File 
have to be named as the Python module function name.

The ZCFG file should contain the following :


serviceType
    Python 
serviceProvider
    the name of the Python module to use as a ZOO Service Provider. For instance, if your 
    script, located in the same directory as your ZOO Kernel, was named my_module.py then 
    you should use my_module (the Python module name) as serviceProvider value in ZCFG file. 

Python Data Structure used
**************************

The Python module's function to be used as a service have to :

- take three arguments : the main configuration, inputs and outputs maps are passed to the 
  Python module as  dictionaries.
- return an integer : corresopnding to the service status code. 

Sample Data Structure
*********************

In the following you 'll find a sample argument passed to the Python module's function for 
the two first main configuration file' sections.

::

  main={
     "main": {"encoding": "utf-8",
              "version": "1.0.0",
              "serverAddress": "http://www.zoo-project.org/zoo/",
              "lang": "fr-FR,en-CA"}, 
     "identification": {"title": "The Zoo WPS Development Server",
                        "abstract": "Development version of ZooWPS.",
                        "fees": "None",
                        "accessConstraints": "none",
                        "keywords": "WPS,GIS,buffer"}
  }

Sample ZOO Python Services Provider
***********************************

The following code represent a simple ZOO Python Services Provider which provides only one 
Service, the HelloPy one.

::

  import sys
  def HelloPy(conf,inputs,outputs):
     outputs["Result"]["value"]="Hello "+inputs["a"]["value"]+" from Python World !"
     return 3

PHP
---

::

  <?
  function HelloPHP(&$main_conf,&$inputs,&$outputs){
     $outputs["Result"]["value"]="Hello ".$inputs[S][value]." from PHP world !";
     return 3;
  }
  ?>

Java
----

::

  import java.util.*;
  public class HelloJava {
    public static int HelloWorldJava(HashMap conf,HashMap inputs, HashMap outputs) {
       HashMap hm1 = new HashMap();
       hm1.put("dataType","string");
       HashMap tmp=(HashMap)(inputs.get("S"));
       java.lang.String v=tmp.get("value").toString();
       hm1.put("value","Hello "+v+" from JAVA WOrld !");
       outputs.put("Result",hm1);
       System.err.println("Hello from JAVA WOrld !");
       return 3;
    }
  }

Javascript
----------

::

  function hellojs(conf,inputs,outputs){
     outputs=new Array();
     outputs[0]={};
     outputs[0]["result"]["value"]="Hello "+inputs[0]["S"]["value"]+" from JS World !";
     return Array(3,outputs);
  }
